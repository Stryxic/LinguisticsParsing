Coronavirus - Connor Reed, 25, beat the killer virus with a glass of hot whisky and honey
He went to hospital after struggling to breathe and could not shake off a bad cough all classic symptoms.
Shocked Connor was kept in hospital for two weeks.
Connor, originally from Llandudno, North Wales, has lived in China for three years.
He said: I was stunned when the doctors told me I was suffering from the virus. I thought I was going to die but I managed to beat it.
I used the inhaler which helped control the cough and drank a hot whisky with honey until that ran out.
Its an old fashioned remedy but it seemed to do the trick.
I did refuse to take the antibiotics the doctors prescribed me because I didnt want to take any medicines.
Connor, who moved to Wuhan last summer to teach English, was discharged from the Zhongnan University Hospital in the city.
He added: It was only when I called back a couple of weeks ago that they told me Id had the coronavirus.
Ive been off work and the boss thinks we will be reopening in a couple of weeks but Im not so sure.
Wuhan is becoming a real ghost town there is hardly anybody in the streets and the shops are running low of fresh fruit and vegetables.
And there is no medicine or masks left in the pharmacies.
If you go out without a mask the police will arrest you.
